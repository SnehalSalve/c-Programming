// array is a collection of similar datatypes with fixed size
//once we declared the size of an array it can not be change
//but in c programming we can allocate meomery manually during runtime.
//this is known as dynamic memory allocation
//to allocate memory dyanamically we used library functions - malloc() calloc() realloc() free() -> this is in <stdlib.h> header

// malloc() - memory allocation
//it reverse the block of memory of number of bytes, it returns pointer of void

//ptr = (caseType*)malloc(size);
